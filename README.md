**Project Overview**

The Amazon Prime TV Shows and Movies project delves into analyzing Amazon Prime Video’s U.S. content library using two comprehensive datasets. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to:

📊 Content Diversity

🌍 Regional Distribution

⭐ IMDb/TMDB Ratings

🔥 Popularity

🎭 Cast and Crew Involvement

This analysis aims to support content strategy, personalized recommendations, and audience engagement insights for streaming platforms.

type – TV show or movie

description – Brief description

release_year – Year of release

age_certification – Age rating

runtime – Length of movie/episode

genres – List of genres

production_countries – Producing countries

seasons – Number of seasons (if TV show)

imdb_id, imdb_score, imdb_votes

tmdb_popularity, tmdb_score

Credits Dataset (credits.csv)

124,235 records of cast and crew

5 attributes:

person_id – Unique person ID

id – Title ID (to link with titles dataset)

name – Actor/Director name
